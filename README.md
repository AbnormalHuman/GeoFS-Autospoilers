# GeoFS-Autospoilers

This is a remix of the spoiler arming addon originally made for Tampermonkey here: https://github.com/gefs-plugins/spoiler-arming
It allows you to arm the spoilers by pressing Shift+ <spoilers key> so that they automatically deploy on touchdown.
  
The code is provided in bookmarklet format. To install this addon, you follow the following procedure:

- Copy the code
- Click the little star icon at the right end of your search bar to make a bookmark
- Click "more"
- Type "GeoFS Addon Chat" in the "Name" box
- Paste the code into the "URL" space
- Click "save"
- Click the bookmark when running GeoFS to run it.
- Note: this is NOT compatible with other addons that use this style of UI (at least not yet).

If the bookmarks bar is not visible when playing GeoFS, right click any bookmark and click "Show bookmarks bar" at the very bottom of the popup menu.

There are a number of other GeoFS addons that can be run as bookmarklets, so it is recommended to make a bookmarks folder of GeoFS addons if you are planning on using multiple of them.
